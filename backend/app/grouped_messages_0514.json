It has a rental yield of 3.21% and a capital gain of 2.24%.\n2.  **2/110 Braeside Road, Greystanes, NSW 2145:** This villa in Greystanes features abundant greenery, low noise exposure, bright lighting, and a well-maintained garden. The kitchen and bathroom are outdated. The listing doesn't have a price, so you will need to contact the agent.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Determine your Cost Base:** This is what you've invested in the property.\n    *   **Original Purchase Price:** The initial price you paid for the property.\n    *   **Additional Costs:** Include expenses directly related to the purchase, such as stamp duty and legal fees.\n    *   **Capital Improvements:** Add the cost of any significant renovations that increased the property's value (e.g., adding a room, a new kitchen). Note that regular maintenance like painting isn't included.\n\n    *Cost Base = Original Purchase Price + Additional Costs + Capital Improvements*\n\n2.  **Determine your Net Sale Proceeds:** This is what you get when you sell.\n    *   **Selling Price:** The amount you sell the property for.\n    *   **Selling Costs:** Deduct expenses associated with the sale, like real estate agent commissions and legal fees.\n\n    *Net Sale Proceeds = Selling Price - Selling Costs*\n\n3.  **Calculate the Capital Gain:**\n    *   Subtract the cost base from the net sale proceeds.\n\n    *Capital Gain = Net Sale Proceeds - Cost Base*\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\n*   **Purchase Price:** $600,000\n*   **Stamp Duty:** $20,000\n*   **Legal Fees (Purchase):** $2,000\n*   **Kitchen Renovation:** $30,000\n*   **Selling Price:** $750,000\n*   **Real Estate Agent Commission:** $15,000\n*   **Legal Fees (Sale):** $2,000\n\n1.  **Cost Base:**\n    *   $600,000 (Purchase Price) + $20,000 (Stamp Duty) + $2,000 (Legal Fees) + $30,000 (Kitchen Reno) = $652,000\n\n2.  **Net Sale Proceeds:**\n    *   $750,000 (Selling Price) - $15,000 (Commission) - $2,000 (Legal Fees) = $733,000\n\n3.  **Capital Gain:**\n    *   $733,000 (Net Sale Proceeds) - $652,000 (Cost Base) = $81,000\n\nIn this example, your capital gain would be $81,000.\n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified illustration. It doesn't include all possible factors, and I am not a financial advisor. Please consult with a professional for personalized advice.\n\nNow that we've covered that, would you like me to focus on searching for properties in Western Sydney with higher potential for capital growth, keeping your $600,000 to $700,000 budget in mind?",

The kitchen and bathroom are also outdated.\n\nI noticed that both of these properties have outdated kitchens and bathrooms, and one doesn't have a listed price.
