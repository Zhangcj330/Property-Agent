Designer Document: Smart Property Buyer Agent

1. Introduction
This document outlines the design and architecture of a Smart Property Buyer Agent, a chatbot-powered system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), web browser tools, APIs, and image processing to recommend properties based on user preferences. The agent interacts with users in a conversational manner, inferring preferences from their queries and responses, and returns personalized property suggestions.

2. Objectives and Scope
User Preference Collection

Extract explicit and implicit preferences from free-form user conversations.
Handle dynamic, evolving requirements over a series of user interactions (budget changes, location focus, style preferences, etc.).
Property Data Enrichment

Integrate with third-party property listing APIs and websites (via browser tools or direct API calls).
Use image processing to analyze property photos (e.g., to identify interior design style, presence of amenities, etc.).
Property Recommendation

Rank and recommend properties based on user preferences.
Provide justifications or explanations for recommendations (e.g., “This property is 10 minutes from the city center, has three bedrooms, and matches your budget.”).
Scalability and Extensibility

Support multiple data sources.
Allow for future enhancements such as advanced analytics, personalization models, or user feedback loops.
3. Requirements
Requirement	Description
Functional	- Chatbot Interface: Users can input queries about property requirements via natural language.
- Preferences Extraction: System infers budget, location, size, style, amenities, etc.
- Search & Filter: System searches property listings based on preferences.
- Property Data Enrichment: System fetches additional details (e.g., neighborhood info, historical pricing) using web tools or APIs.
- Recommendation Ranking: Provide top property options with rationale.
Technical	- LLM Integration: Use a Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-based) for parsing user input and summarizing preferences.
- APIs and Browser Tools: Communicate with listing websites (via official APIs or browser automation if necessary).
- Image Processing: Analyze property photos to extract structured data (e.g., presence of a pool, yard size, interior condition).
- Data Storage: Maintain property listings, user profiles, and conversation logs.
Non-Functional	- Performance: The system should respond to user queries within acceptable latency (e.g., < 2 seconds for typical queries).
- Reliability: Handle large volumes of property listings and simultaneous user sessions.
- Security & Privacy: Protect user data. Comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).
User Experience (UX)	- Conversational Flow: Provide natural, coherent responses. Prompt user for clarifications when needed.
- Clear Visual Output (if using a graphical chatbot): Summaries, images, and interactive elements for each recommended property.
- Feedback Mechanism: Let users upvote or downvote suggestions and refine preferences.

User Interface (UI)

A chatbot or conversational interface that captures free-text queries from the user.
LLM-Based Inference

An NLP engine (powered by a Large Language Model) that parses user requests to extract preferences (location, budget, number of rooms, property type, etc.).
Infers hidden preferences from user conversation history (e.g., user previously mentioned needing a home office).
Property Recommendation & Scoring Engine

Receives structured preferences from the LLM.
Performs a multi-criteria scoring (location match, price alignment, amenity match, etc.).
Interacts with the Property Data Cache to retrieve candidate properties.
Property Data Cache

Stores listings, metadata, and additional enriched data (e.g., school district info, historical pricing, local crime rates).
Integrates with external APIs or a browser-based scrapper to populate or update listings in real-time.
External Integrations

APIs and Browser Tools: For real estate listings, location services, neighborhood data, etc.
Image Processing: Analyzes property images to identify certain features (e.g., condition of rooms, presence of certain appliances, or even style matching).
5. Detailed Components
5.1 User Interface Layer
Conversation Handler:

Receives input from users in natural language.
Displays the system’s responses.
Maintains conversation state (session handling).
Presentation Layer:

Shows property listings in an organized format: address, photos, price, property features.
Allows direct interaction such as “Save to Favorites,” “Next Recommendation,” or “Refine Filter.”
5.2 LLM-Based Inference
Preference Extraction Module:

Uses LLM to parse user conversation and detect key preference entities (e.g., “budget under $500k,” “location near downtown,” “3 bedrooms,” “pet-friendly,” etc.).
Continuously updates a user preference model with each conversation turn.
Contextual Understanding:

Retains conversation history to identify changes in preference or new constraints.
Example: If user says, “I’d like something with a backyard,” the system notes this and adds a “backyard” preference to the user model.
5.3 Property Recommendation & Scoring Engine
Candidate Selection:

Queries the Property Data Cache for properties matching broad location and budget filters.
Retrieves initial set of potential listings (e.g., up to 100 matches).
Scoring:

For each candidate property, compute a score based on:
Budget Fit: Price within or close to budget.
Location Fit: Distance from user-specified locations or commute distance.
Feature Fit: Amenities (garage, pool, etc.), property type, size.
Quality Assessment: Leveraging image analysis or textual property descriptions (e.g., “recently renovated kitchen,” “hardwood floors,” etc.).
Sort candidates by overall score.
Recommendation Generation:

Formats the top-ranked properties into a user-friendly recommendation list.
Uses the LLM to generate a concise explanation for each recommended property.
5.4 Property Data Cache
Listings Database:

Stores property details: address, price, property type, square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, images, description, etc.
Metadata Storage:

Stores additional data from external sources (e.g., walkability score, school ratings, noise levels, crime stats).
Sync Services:

API Integration: Periodically fetch new listings or updates from real estate APIs.
Browser Automation: If official APIs are unavailable, use a headless browser tool (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) to scrape data in compliance with site terms.
5.5 Image Processing
Feature Extraction:

Use computer vision models to identify notable features from photos (e.g., presence of kitchen island, swimming pool, backyard size).
Assess interior conditions (basic rating if possible).
Style Classification (Optional):

Classify images into styles (modern, rustic, etc.) to match user preferences.
6. Data Flow
User Initiates Chat:
E.g., “I’m looking for a house in the suburbs, under $400k, with at least 3 bedrooms.”
LLM Preference Extraction:
System identifies “budget=400k”, “type=house,” “location=suburbs,” “bedrooms=3+.”
Candidate Query:
Recommendation engine searches the Property Data Cache for matching or near-matching listings.
Data Enrichment:
For each candidate, system may fetch missing details (e.g., retrieve updated photos, neighborhood ratings).
Scoring & Ranking:
Properties are scored based on alignment with user preferences, sorted by relevance.
Recommendations to User:
System presents top properties with short explanations (generated by LLM or a template).
User Feedback:
User can refine the search or indicate preferences changed. The cycle repeats.

8. Security and Privacy Considerations
User Data Protection

Store minimal personal data. Encrypt sensitive fields (if storing user contact info, etc.).
Use secure channels (HTTPS) for all data communication.
API Authentication

Secure tokens or OAuth for any external listing API.
Conversation Logs

If storing conversation logs for improvement of the LLM or user personalization, ensure anonymization or user consent.
Regulatory Compliance

Comply with GDPR or other relevant data protection regulations.
Provide a way for users to request data deletion.
9. Future Enhancements
Advanced Personalization

Real-Time Bidding or Negotiation

Automatic pre-qualification checks or mortgage calculations integrated with banking APIs.
Augmented Reality / Virtual Tours

Integrate with 3D or 360-degree view solutions to enrich user experience.
Predictive Pricing

Use historical data and market trends to forecast future property values or identify best timing for purchase.
